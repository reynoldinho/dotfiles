Or do zed provide it free?\n\n\n\n# How I Work as an AI\n\nI'm Claude, an AI assistant created by Anthropic. I run on a large language model (LLM) that has been trained on a diverse dataset of text and fine-tuned with human feedback to be helpful, harmless, and honest.\n\n## My Functionality in Zed\n\nWhen you interact with me in Zed:\n\n1. Your prompt is sent to Anthropic's servers\n2. My model processes your request and generates a response\n3. The response is returned to your Zed editor\n\n## API Keys and Costs\n\n**You do not need to provide your own API keys** to use me within Zed. Zed has integrated Claude as a feature, and they handle the API connection and associated costs. This service is provided as part of the Zed editor experience.\n\nThe Zed team covers the API costs for reasonable usage, making this feature effectively free for you as an end user. There are likely usage limits in place to prevent abuse of the system, but normal usage should be completely free.\n\nIf you wanted to use Claude outside of Zed in your own applications, you would need to:\n1. Sign up for an Anthropic API key\n2. Pay for API usage according to Anthropic's pricing\n\nBut within Zed itself, everything is already set up for you to use without additional accounts or costs.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":116}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":59},"start":163,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":117}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":62},"start":164,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":118}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":63},"start":165,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":119}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":72},"start":166,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":122}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":73},"start":1390,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":121}}}],"summary":"Understanding AI Integration Costs","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}],"thought_process_output_sections":[]}
